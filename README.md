# OpenGL Example Programs

This repository contains a collection of OpenGL example programs built using CMake. These examples are designed to help you get started with OpenGL and understand modern rendering techniques using GLFW and GLAD.

## üìÅ Structure

Each folder within the `Part-1 Getting Started` directory contains a specific OpenGL concept, such as:

- `1.1 HelloWindow`: Create a window using GLFW.
- `5.1 Transformations`: Apply transformations to objects.

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
- OpenGL (comes with your OS or graphics drivers)
- CMake ‚â• 3.10
